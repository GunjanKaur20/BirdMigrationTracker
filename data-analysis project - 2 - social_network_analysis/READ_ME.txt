Social Network Analysis | Datasets - http://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6144/1236498.full
 
Many systems of scientific and societal interest
consist of a large number of interacting components.
The structure of these systems can be represented
as networks where network nodes represent the components,
and network edges, the interactions between the components.
Network analysis can be used to study how pathogens, behaviors,
and information spread in social networks,
having important implications for our understanding of epidemics
and the planning of effective interventions.
In a biological context, at a molecular level,
network analysis can be applied to gene regulation networks, signal
transduction networks, protein interaction networks, and much,
much more.
This case study first introduces some basic concepts about networks,
we'll then write a Python function to generate very simple random graphs,
and finally, we'll analyze some basic properties of social networks collected in different rural villages in India.
